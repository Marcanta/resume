# UI Ideas

### Try to enhance spacing and separator like this:
*(maybe some **animated gradiant** to add some relief and make it organic)*

### And upgrade the UI/UX of bigger device, like this:
**Try making these floating blocks, let the gradiant background spacing them (the hatch zone should be the background gradiant)**
*Other thought, try to make the floating blocks background black or translucid*
